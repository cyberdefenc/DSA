 Hashing in python

 hash_list=[0]*11 # will create 11 index of list with intial values in each as 0

 Every operation in Dictionary takes O(1) time

P1. Read from list and insert into Dictionary,if already exist just update it's key(frequency)
   TC=O(n)
   SC=O(n)

P2. Read from list and insert into Dictionary,if already exist just update it's key(frequency)
    more conscise version
    TC=O(n)
    SC=O(n)

P3. Read for a list(m) from a list(n) and make hash_map which only stores the frequency of elements and between 1<=n[i]<=10,n,m can have 10^8 elements

P4. Create hash map of character ??????????????
