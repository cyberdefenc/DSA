P1. Check whether a given number is palindrome or not
     TC=O(log10(n))
     SC=O(1)

P2. Check whether a given number is Armstrong or not using log
     TC=O((log n)²)
     SC=O(1)

P3. Check whether a given number is Armstrong or not using len(str(x))
     TC=O((log n)²)
     SC=O(log n)

P4. Check whether a given number is Armstrong or not but if x=0
     TC=O((log n)²)
     SC=O(1)

P5. Find and print the factors of a given number
     TC=O(n)
     SC=O(1)

P6. Find and print the factors of a given number by list 
     TC=O(n)
     SC=O(k)
     where k is total number of factors

P7. Find and print the factors of a given number by list 
     TC=O(n)
     SC=O(k)
     where k is total number of factors

     all numbers have its factors only n/2
     like n=10
     so 10 is only divisible by or it has factors less than and equal to its half
     means 1,2,3,4,5,10
     not by 6,7,8,9

P8. Find factors of a given number using root
